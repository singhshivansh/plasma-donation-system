The Plasma Donation Database system is designed to streamline the donation process during the covid times. This system encorporates all the required entities and is an complete package for assisting the healthworkers during the crisis times. The coronavirus pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. Each and every group of people have been affected because of it. In this scenario, Plasma Therapy is seen as an effective way of treating the Covid patients. It involves transferring of the antibodies produced by the recovered patients to the infected patients. This may increase the chances of the infected patients developing immunity against the virus. This process of voluntarily donating the plasma, if streamlined through a proper system, and carried out as per plans, could help us to eradicate it. This system is one such attempt to streamline the Plasma donation process.
